# Bad bank 
How to use
- create an account via the create account page, this automatically logs you in
- visit all-data page via the navbar and see your new account and password
- go deposit some amount on the deposit page and see your balance update
- well, you can withdraw too. Unfortunately you can't cash it but you see your balance and have reduced.

The project is bootstrapped with create-react-app on react and context.

Here is a gif on the app functionalities

## CHALLENGES FACED IN THE APP
- time was a major constraint for me and how I resolved it was to use rudement functions to get things done although at cleaner code expense. Altogether, I feel the code is clean enough to read through with strong functional programming principles
- To avoid prop drills, I had to turn to use react context unlike passing props around which I used on the other dorm project

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
